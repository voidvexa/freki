# Freki

> Built by a human, pair-programmed with [Claude](https://claude.ai). The AI writes the signals *and* some of the code that generates them. Skynet starts with ETFs, apparently.

ETF signal scanner that runs on a schedule during US market hours. It fetches price data for a list of ETFs, computes technical indicators on two timeframes, sends the data to Claude for analysis, and delivers actionable trade signals to Telegram.

## How It Works

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Entry timeframe | 4-hour candles (60 bars) |
| Trend bias | Daily candles (100 bars) |
| Stop loss | ATR(4h) x 1.5 |
| Take profit | Stop distance x 2.5 (R:R = 1:2.5) |
| Scan | Daily at 12:20 ET |
| Weekly digest | Friday 16:30 ET |

## Pipeline

Each scan follows this sequence for every symbol in the watchlist:

### 1. Fetch Data

The app calls the Alpaca API and requests two sets of candles:

- **60 bars of 4h candles** -- roughly the last week of price action for entry timing
- **100 bars of daily candles** -- the last ~5 months for trend context

### 2. Compute Indicators

For both timeframes, the following indicators are computed from raw OHLCV data:

| Indicator | Purpose |
|---|---|
| MACD bullish? | Is momentum pointing up or down? |
| MACD expanding? | Is that momentum getting stronger or fading? |
| Price above EMA21? | Is price above or below its recent average? |
| RSI (0-100) | Is the ETF overbought (>70), oversold (<30), or neutral? |
| Volume ratio | Is current volume higher or lower than the 20-bar average? |
| OBV rising? | Is money flowing in (buying) or out (selling)? |

ATR is computed on the entry timeframe for stop loss and take profit calculations.

> These indicators work for both long and short signals. For example, "MACD bullish = false" means bearish momentum; "Price above EMA21 = false" means a downtrend; "OBV rising = false" means money flowing out. Claude interprets the full picture in both directions.

### 3. Technical Pre-Filter

Before sending data to Claude, each symbol must pass a hard technical gate:

- Both 4h and 1d price above EMA21 (for long candidates; inverse for short)
- MACD trend direction aligned on both timeframes
- RSI within the configured zone (default: 40–70 for longs, 30–60 for shorts)

Symbols that don't pass are logged, stored to the `filtered_signals` table for audit, and skipped. This reduces Claude API calls and avoids evaluating noise. No Telegram message is sent for filtered symbols.

### 4. Build Summary

The indicators are formatted into a readable text block:

```
Price: $550.00
4H: MACD bullish (expanding) | above EMA21 | RSI 58.2 | ATR $1.05 | Vol 1.4x | OBV rising
1D: MACD bullish (expanding) | above EMA21 | RSI 62.1 | ATR $5.75 | Vol 0.9x | OBV rising
```

### 5. Claude Evaluation

The summary is sent to Claude with a system prompt instructing it to act as a conservative swing signal analyst.

In addition to the indicator summary, Claude also receives a macro context block with live FRED economic data (Fed Funds rate, CPI YoY, HY credit spread, yield curve spread, unemployment) and real-time market indicators (VIX, SKEW). This lets Claude factor macro regime into its decision (risk-on vs risk-off, credit stress, fear gauge). FRED data is optional — if `FRED_API_KEY` is not set in `.env`, the macro block is omitted and Claude evaluates on technicals alone.

Claude reads the indicators, reasons through them, and responds with:

```json
{
  "direction": "long",
  "reasoning": "Both timeframes aligned bullish..."
}
```

`direction` is one of `long`, `short`, or `neutral`. Reasoning is always required so audit queries can show *why* Claude chose neutral, not just that it did.

### 6. Calculate Stop Loss and Take Profit

Only for `long` or `short` decisions. Neutral signals carry no SL/TP.

Using the entry timeframe ATR (e.g. $1.05):

|  | Long | Short |
|---|---|---|
| Entry | $550.00 | $550.00 |
| Stop Loss | $550.00 - $1.58 = **$548.42** | $550.00 + $1.58 = **$551.58** |
| Take Profit | $550.00 + $3.94 = **$553.94** | $550.00 - $3.94 = **$546.06** |

Stop distance = ATR x 1.5 = $1.05 x 1.5 = $1.58. Take profit = stop distance x 2.5 = $3.94. Risk-to-reward is always **1:2.5**.

### 7. Telegram Notification

A Telegram message is sent for any symbol that passes the technical pre-filter — `long`, `short`, *and* `neutral`. The header summarizes the decision and the body contains the full signal payload as JSON, so every indicator value, the macro context, and Claude's reasoning are preserved in the chat history.

**Long / short:**

```
*LONG SPY* AT $550.00 | SL $548.42 | TP $553.94

```json
{
  "emitted_at": "2026-05-05T16:21:03.441+00:00",
  "symbol": "SPY",
  "direction": "long",
  "entry_price": 550.00,
  "bar_time": "2026-05-05 12:00 ET",
  "stop": 548.42,
  "target": 553.94,
  "reasoning": "Both timeframes aligned bullish...",
  "model": "claude-sonnet-4-6",
  "atr": 1.05,
  "rsi_4h": 58.2,
  "rsi_1d": 62.1,
  "macd_4h_bullish": true,
  "ema_4h_above": true,
  "ema_1d_above": true,
  "vol_ratio_4h": 1.4,
  "obv_4h_rising": true,
  "macro": { "vix": 18.3, "skew": 128.0, ... }
}
```
```

**Neutral:**

```
*NEUTRAL SPY* AT $550.00

```json
{ ...same shape, with "stop": null, "target": null... }
```
```

### 8. Storage / Audit Trail

Every symbol that has market data is recorded to one of three SQLite tables in `journal/signals.sqlite`. This is the audit trail for evaluating the filtering and signaling strategy after the fact.

| Table | When it's written | Telegram? | Stop / Target |
|---|---|---|---|
| `filtered_signals` | Symbol failed the technical pre-filter (Claude was never called) | No | N/A |
| `neutral_signals` | Passed filter, Claude returned `neutral` | Yes | N/A |
| `signals` | Passed filter, Claude returned `long` or `short` | Yes | Yes |

All three tables capture the full indicator snapshot (4h + 1d) and the macro context block as JSON. `filtered_signals` adds a `filter_reason` column; `neutral_signals` and `signals` both store Claude's reasoning and the model name. This means the data behind every decision — including the rejections — is queryable.

### 9. Repeat

Steps 1-8 repeat for each symbol in the watchlist. After all symbols are scanned, the app sleeps until the next scheduled scan.

## End of Week

At **16:30 ET on Fridays**, the app sends a weekly summary to Telegram with:
- Total signals emitted that week
- Long vs. short breakdown
- Signal count per symbol
